        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            
            <div id="abouttext">
                <p>I was born and raised in Brussels, Belgium where I graduated from The International School of Brussels with the international baccalaureate diploma. I am bilingual as I speak fluent French and English with an elementary proficiency in Spanish. I am now currently an undergraduate student at the University of Miami and therefore living in Florida, USA.</p>

                <p>I was involved with art classes throughout my high school years. During my international baccalaureate years, I took a visual arts higher level class, which influenced me in the choice of my university educational field. Majoring in Creative Advertising and minoring in Interactive Media at the University of Miami, I hope to strengthen my skills in the creative and marketing areas of the advertising world as well as being able to design and create digital art through different mediums for different purposes. Thanks to the courses I have taken so far, I have learned the art, craft and business of how to promote brands from an integrated marketing perspective. I have developed a strong base in advertising that emphasizes strategy building, data gathering and analysis, creative development, media planning skills, and web designing.</p>

                <p>By pursuing this educational path, I am looking forward to any internship or work opportunities in creative design and advertising companies, hoping to master the art of advertising and communication through creative arts and therefore potentially becoming a graphic designer.</p>
